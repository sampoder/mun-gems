Greetings delegate, 

It is our pleasure to welcome you to the first Model United Nations Conference at GEMS World Academy Singapore. 

MUN@GEMS was formed in 2020 and we foster to create a constructive platform for open dialogue on complex global issues involving international peace and security, political, economical, and social issues. MUN@GEMS emphasizes on the process of coming up with a resolution for a global issue rather than the result of it.

At MUN@GEMS, delegates will gain insight into the world of international relations by assuming the roles of UN representatives and members of other international bodies. MUN@GEMS is a great platform for delegates to collaborate and come up with solutions that solve the main problems introduced during committee sessions. We also ensure that delegates have equal opportunities to debate and speak in order to boost confidence and self-esteem.

'With great power comes great responsibility' and therefore there are certain limitations to negotiations when powerful nations and representatives are involved. Therefore, we hope that delegates are able to balance out national and international interests.

Your individual participation would be extremely valuable. Please check out our [website](https://mun-gems.vercel.app/) and pass on this letter to those who you feel would be interested. Registration for this conference is open from 28/12/20 to 31/1/21.

It is highly recommended for students with no prior experience in MUN to take part in this conference to get to know more about how UN works. 

We will be providing a delegate handbook with all the necessary information regarding the schedule,  rules of procedure, dress code and the logistics of the conference. 

Thanks again for your support and we look forward to your participation. 

Sincerely,

Executive team of MUN@GEMS

    Rules of Procedure
  </h2>
</Divider>
<p>The following rules outline how exactly the conference will run.
It's important to read the rules throughly so you and other delegates can have
the best expirence during the conference.
</p>

### Delegate roll call
This is the process by which the chairs call out the countries in order to 
find out and see who is attending and how many countries are present during 
committee sessions. This way, the chairs are able to calculate the number of 
delegates required within substantial and procedural voting. When you hear your 
name, you can simply reply with present/present and voting. If you say “Present 
and voting” you can’t abstain from voting. <br />

### Opening speeches

1. Character’s should prepare an opening speech for 1 minute
2. Character’s must speak in third person during formal debate (first person pronouns are not accepted)

This 1 minute speech should be accustomed towards the wishes of the 
delegates. The opening speech must include the character’s perspective 
on each topic and what they wish to accomplish during the committee session. 

### General speaker’s list

The committees should have the general speaker’s list open on the 
topic area that will be discussed during the session. The dias 
will open the general speaker's list or entertain any motions 
that would like to open the speaker’s list. A member can enter 
itself onto the general speaker’s list by sending a letter to 
the dias or using the raise hand feature on Zoom. 


### Lobby and merge process

The opening speech is extremely important because it gives other character’s a perspective on what certain character’s want to achieve during committee sessions. 

This is followed by lobbying where character’s would present their solutions which they brought up during the conference. With the use of drives and folders, character’s would then compile several solutions and  come up with a detailed resolution also known as a Merged Resolution. This resolution is then sent out to the chair and the approval panel. 

Once lobbying and Merging are sorted out, the chair would sort out the resolutions in order and call the main submitter of the first resolution to read out their operative clauses. 

### Amendments

An amendment is a change in a certain clause in the resolution submitted by a Bloc. It is a written statement that either adds, deletes or changes a certain operative clause in a draft resolution. This process is used to strengthen the agreement on a resolution by allowing delegates to change the operative clauses. 

#### Voting procedures

When the discussion on the resolution has finished, voting would be conducted by chairs on the resolution as a whole. Characters can either vote for, against or abstain from voting.

#### Points and motions

Characters are allowed to use points and motions when communicating with their chair. It is important to know when and how to use these. 

##### Points

1. *Point of Information:* This is used by a character to get more information about something that isn’t clearly understood during committee sessions. 
2. *Point of Personal Privilege:* This is used when a character has a personal problem and faces discomfort which affects their ability to participate during committee sessions.(i.e temperature of the room, distractions of the room, audibility)
3. *Point of Order:* This is used when a character has a problem with the rules of procedure 

##### Motions

Motions are used by characters to request the committee regarding a particular wish a delegate would like to accomplish. Below are a following list of possible motions;

1. *Motion to go into a moderated/unmoderated caucus:* This motion is used when a character would like to give additional speeches about any topic or resolution and make amendments. In a moderated caucus, characters need to sit in their respective seats and communicate with other delegates through note form. In an unmoderated Caucus, characters are allowed to freely move around the room and communicate with other delegates. 
2. *Motion to reconsider a resolut:* This motion is presented only when all resolutions have been reviewed and there is more time for time on debate regarding previous resolutions
3. *Motion to adjourn debate:* This motion is presented when characters wish to stop debating on a specific resolution
4. *Motion to extend debate:* This is presented when characters are called one by one to state their individual vote. 
5. *Motion to move into time for/against:* This motion is presented when characters would like to talk for and against the resolutions presented during committee sessions. 

#### Voting procedures

These are resolutions that haven’t been voted upon yet. Characters write draft resolutions with each other. 

There are 3 main parts to a draft resolution: the heading, the preamble and operative clauses. The heading shows the committee and topic. It also lists the signatories and the main submitter(s). The preamble and operative clauses then explain further onto the main ideas that need to be done in order to solve the situation. There is no particular format that needs to be followed because it is just a combination of raw ideas that can later be combined into 1 resolution when characters collaborate and find out more about the measures that other countries want to take. 

#### Resolution

The resolution consists of 2 parts: the **preambulatory** and **operative** clauses. 

The preambulatory clause states the issues that the bloc wants to solve and why it wants to solve that particular issue. In the preambulatory clause, delegates can make reference to previous statements made by organizations affiliated with your committee. 

The Operative clause contains the list of solutions that the sponsor would like to propose. These clauses need to be applicable not only domestically but internationally as well. Each clause should provide the main idea and the sub clause within each clause would provide information on how this idea would be put into place. The clauses should be numbered and it should begin with an operative word that is underlined. 

If sub clauses are required, they should end with a comma. Each total clause should be separated by a double space.

First offence: If a character violates one of the rules and regulations, He will be left with a warning

Second Offence: If a character violates the rules and regulations a second time, they will be temporarily kicked out of the meeting for 15 minutes and the character will not be allowed to speak regarding the topic for 2 times in a row.

### Dress code

Since MUN@GEMS is following the theme of Fantasy, all students participating must wear costumes according to their assigned character. If the students don't have a costume related to their assigned character, they can wear clothes that match the colour code of the character.
